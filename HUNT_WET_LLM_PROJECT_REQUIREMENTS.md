# HUNT WET LLM - PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

## WHAT WE WANT (THE REAL GOAL):
- **AUTONOMOUS HUNTING LLM** that goes off and learns hunting by itself
- LLM that actively searches/scrapes hunting knowledge from the web 24/7
- Self-improving hunting AI that gets smarter without human intervention
- Goes out like an "eagle" to hunt for hunting data continuously
- Learns from millions of hunting sources (forums, Reddit, YouTube, guides)
- Reports back with new hunting insights automatically
- Runs in background for hours/days learning hunting
- WORLD'S FIRST hunting-specific autonomous learning LLM

## WHAT WE DON'T WANT (COMMON MISTAKES):
- ❌ Basic chatbot that just answers hunting questions
- ❌ Standard LLM fine-tuning on small datasets (3-10 examples)
- ❌ Passive LLM that waits for prompts
- ❌ One-time training that stops learning
- ❌ Manual data collection
- ❌ Just another OpenAI API clone
- ❌ Static knowledge base

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Autonomous web scraping capabilities
- Continuous learning loops
- Background processing (24/7 operation)
- Self-directed knowledge acquisition
- Dynamic hunting knowledge expansion
- Real-time hunting data integration

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- LLM autonomously learns hunting for hours without intervention
- Continuously discovers new hunting knowledge online
- Self-improves hunting expertise over time
- Becomes THE definitive hunting knowledge AI

## NOTES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:
- This is NOT standard LLM training
- Requires agent frameworks + continuous learning systems
- User expects autonomous behavior, not manual prompting
- Focus on AUTONOMOUS learning, not static training
