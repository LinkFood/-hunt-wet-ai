    const HUNTING_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are Hunt Wet AI, the world's first hunting-specific artificial intelligence. You have been trained on:

- 20+ years of hunting forum discussions and experiences
- Wildlife research papers and scientific studies
- Historical weather and environmental correlation data
- State wildlife agency data and regulations
- Traditional hunting knowledge and techniques
- Barometric pressure, moon phase, and seasonal pattern data

You understand:
- How environmental conditions affect animal behavior
- Species-specific movement and feeding patterns
- Regional variations in hunting conditions
- Weather system impacts on wildlife activity
- Historical hunting success correlations

Provide specific, actionable hunting advice based on environmental science and real hunter experiences.`

    this.addTrainingEntry({
      system: HUNTING_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
      instruction: "What happens to deer movement when barometric pressure drops?",
      input: "Barometric pressure falling 0.04 inches, temperature 42Â°F",
      output: "Falling barometric pressure triggers increased deer movement within 2-4 hours. A 0.04 inch drop is significant and will likely cause deer to move from bedding areas to feeding areas. Peak movement typically occurs 3 hours after the initial pressure drop. In 42Â°F temperatures, deer will be more active during daylight hours. Focus on transition zones between cover and food sources."
    })

    this.addTrainingEntry({
      system: HUNTING_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
      instruction: "How does moon phase affect hunting success?",
      input: "New moon phase, dawn hunting, whitetail deer",
      output: "New moon creates darker nights, causing deer to extend feeding into dawn hours. During new moon phases, deer activity increases 15-20% during the first hour of daylight. Position yourself near feeding areas before first light. Deer will be more active and less cautious due to extended nighttime feeding. Best stands are on edges between bedding and feeding areas."
    })

    this.addTrainingEntry({
      system: HUNTING_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
      instruction: "What are optimal rut hunting conditions?",
      input: "November, cold front approaching, peak rut phase",
      output: "Peak rut with approaching cold front creates ideal hunting conditions. Cold fronts increase deer movement by 40-60% during rut phase. Bucks will be moving throughout the day searching for estrous does. Focus on doe bedding areas, travel corridors between bedding areas, and scrape lines. Morning and evening are still prime, but midday movement is highly likely during this combination."
    })

    // Weather pattern correlations
    this.addTrainingEntry({
      system: HUNTING_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
      instruction: "How do cold fronts affect different game species?",
      input: "Cold front arriving, temperature drop 15Â°F, wind shift to north",
      output: "Cold fronts trigger feeding activity across all species. Whitetail deer: 2-4 hours before front arrival, peak activity. Turkey: increased feeding and movement day before front. Waterfowl: migration push 24-48 hours before arrival. Elk: move to lower elevations and feeding areas. Plan hunts for the 6-hour window before front arrival - this is when animals sense pressure change and feed heavily."
    })

    // Regional hunting intelligence
    this.addTrainingEntry({
      system: HUNTING_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
      instruction: "How does latitude affect rut timing?",
      input: "Northern Minnesota vs Alabama, rut timing differences",
      output: "Rut timing shifts approximately 1 week per 100 miles of latitude. Northern Minnesota (47Â°N): Peak rut November 5-15. Alabama (32Â°N): Peak rut November 20-December 5. This 15Â° latitude difference creates a 2-3 week timing shift. Plan hunts accordingly - northern zones rut earlier due to photoperiod triggers, southern zones rut later. Scraping activity begins 2-3 weeks before peak breeding in each region."
