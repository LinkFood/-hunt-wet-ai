# üéØ HUNT WET AI - QUICK STATUS

## **WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW**

### ‚úÖ What Works:
- Core chat interface with AI hunting advice
- Real-time weather + lunar data
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Production build succeeds
- Deployed on GitHub, ready for Vercel

### üöß What's Broken:
- Weather/Intel tabs show fake placeholder data
- Outcome tracking UI exists but backend not wired
- Supabase tables may not exist yet
- Some APIs built but not connected to UI

### ‚ùå What We Cut:
- **All custom LLM infrastructure** ($200 wasted experiment)
- Python training scripts, RunPod setup, data scrapers
- That entire dream is DEAD - GPT-4 + Supabase is better

---

## **STRATEGIC DECISIONS MADE TODAY**

1. **No Custom LLM** - Waste of money, GPT-4 is better
2. **Supabase = Your LLM** - Store outcomes, GPT reads them = personalized AI
3. **Friends-First Launch** - Build for 5-10 hunting buddies first
4. **Data Moat Strategy** - Logged hunts = competitive advantage
5. **No Public Launch** - Until proven with friends (6-12 months)

---

## **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES**

### This Week:
1. Clean up dead LLM code (remove Python files)
2. Verify Supabase database works
3. Connect Weather tab to live data
4. Test outcome tracking end-to-end
5. Deploy to Vercel

### This Month:
1. Get 5 hunting buddies using it
2. Log 20+ hunts with outcomes
3. Build pattern recognition from logged data
4. Prove AI actually learns from outcomes

### This Season:
1. 50+ logged hunts minimum
2. Proven prediction accuracy (60%+ success)
3. Perfect mobile UX for field use
4. Ready for local beta expansion

## **KEY FILES**

- **`CURRENT_ROADMAP.md`** - Full detailed roadmap (read this!)
- **`README.md`** - Project overview
- **`STATUS.md`** - This quick status file
- **`.env.local`** - API keys (DO NOT COMMIT)

---

## **NEXT STEPS FOR ANY DEVELOPER**

1. Read `CURRENT_ROADMAP.md` (comprehensive plan)
2. Delete all Python LLM training files (see roadmap for list)
3. Verify Supabase connection and schema
4. Wire up Weather/Intel tabs to real APIs
5. Test outcome logging end-to-end

---

## **CRITICAL INSIGHT**

**You don't need a custom LLM.**

GPT-4 reading YOUR Supabase database of logged hunts = personalized hunting AI.

The competitive moat is THE DATA (logged outcomes), not the model.

**Status:** üöß Active development - Milestone 1 in progress
