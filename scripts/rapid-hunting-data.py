            "output": "Significant pressure drop of 0.05 inches triggers major deer movement within 2-4 hours. At 45°F, deer will be highly active during daylight. Focus on transition zones between bedding and feeding areas. Success rate increases 65% during these conditions."
        },
        {
            "instruction": "What happens to hunting when pressure rises rapidly?",
            "input": "High pressure system moving in, 30.25+ inches",
            "output": "High pressure systems reduce deer activity by 40%. Animals become less active and stay bedded longer. Wait for pressure to stabilize or start dropping. Best strategy is to hunt travel corridors during brief movement windows."
        },
        {
            "instruction": "How do cold fronts affect different game species?",
            "input": "Cold front arriving, 15°F temperature drop expected",
            "output": "Cold fronts trigger feeding frenzy 4-6 hours before arrival. Whitetail: 70% increase in movement. Turkey: relocate to sheltered areas. Waterfowl: major migration push. Hunt the 'calm before the storm' period."

    # Moon Phase Intelligence

            "input": "New moon phase, dawn hunting session",
            "output": "New moon creates darker nights, extending deer feeding into dawn hours. Activity increases 25% during first hour of daylight. Position near feeding areas before first light. Deer less cautious due to extended nighttime activity."
        },
        {
            "instruction": "What's the best moon phase for hunting?",
            "input": "Planning hunt around moon phases",
            "output": "Quarter moons (waxing/waning) provide optimal hunting. Moon overhead during dawn/dusk creates peak activity windows. Full moon reduces dawn activity but increases midday movement. New moon extends feeding into daylight hours."
        },
        {
            "instruction": "How does moon overhead time affect game movement?",
            "input": "Moon overhead at 6:30 AM",
            "output": "Moon overhead triggers major feeding period. Expect peak game activity 30 minutes before and after overhead time. If overhead at 6:30 AM, hunt 6:00-7:00 AM window. This correlates with solunar theory for maximum success."

            "input": "Early November, pre-rut signs appearing",
            "output": "Pre-rut focus on scrape lines and rub patterns. Bucks establish dominance and territory. Hunt downwind of active scrapes. Grunt calls and rattling become effective. Movement increases 40% as bucks search for estrous does."
        },
        {
            "instruction": "What are the best rut hunting conditions?",
            "input": "Peak rut timing with cold front",
            "output": "Peak rut + cold front = ideal conditions. Cold weather triggers increased daylight movement during rut. Bucks move throughout day searching for does. Success rates peak at 75-80%. Focus on doe bedding areas and travel corridors."

            "instruction": "How do storm systems affect hunting?",
            "input": "Thunderstorm approaching in 4 hours",
            "output": "Animals sense approaching storms 4-6 hours ahead. Expect increased feeding activity before storm hits. After storm passes, game activity spikes within 2 hours. Plan hunts for pre-storm and immediate post-storm windows."

        {
            "instruction": "What temperature ranges are best for hunting?",
            "input": "Temperature forecast 35-50°F range",
            "output": "Optimal hunting temperatures: 35-50°F triggers maximum game activity. Below 32°F: reduced movement except for feeding. Above 60°F: animals seek shade, limited movement. 40-45°F range shows highest success rates across all species."
        },
        {
            "instruction": "How does wind direction affect hunting strategy?",
            "input": "North wind 10-15 mph, consistent direction",
            "output": "Consistent north wind ideal for hunting. Position stands south of expected game trails. Wind carries scent away from approaching animals. Avoid swirling winds near valleys or obstacles. Steady 10-15 mph provides good scent control without excessive noise."

            "input": "Early season vs late season hunting strategies",
            "output": "Early season (September-October): Pattern predictable food sources. Late season (December-January): Focus on survival needs - food and shelter. Early season success: 60% food plots. Late season success: 70% thermal cover near food sources."
        },
        {
            "instruction": "How do acorn crops affect deer hunting?",
            "input": "Heavy acorn year vs crop failure",
            "output": "Heavy acorn year: Deer scatter widely, harder to pattern. Focus on oak ridges and mast-producing trees. Crop failure year: Deer concentrate on remaining food sources. Higher success rates at agricultural fields and food plots. Pattern shifts dramatically based on mast production."

            "input": "Planning all-day sit for whitetail",
            "output": "Whitetail daily pattern: Peak movement 30 minutes before sunrise, 30 minutes after sunset. Secondary peaks: 10-11 AM and 2-3 PM during rut. Midday movement increases during cold fronts and rut phases. Plan stands on transition routes between bedding and feeding."

            "instruction": "How do turkey behavior patterns differ from deer?",
            "input": "Turkey hunting strategy vs deer hunting",
            "output": "Turkey patterns: Dawn activity at roost sites, midday feeding in open areas, evening return to roost. More weather sensitive than deer. Avoid hunting during rain or high winds. Focus on strutting zones during spring, feeding areas during fall."

        {
            "instruction": "What triggers waterfowl migration?",
            "input": "Predicting waterfowl migration timing",
