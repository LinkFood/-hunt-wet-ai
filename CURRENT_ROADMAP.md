# 🎯 HUNT WET AI - CURRENT ROADMAP
**Last Updated: 2025-10-03**

---

## **PROJECT VISION (REVISED)**

Building a **hunting data sidekick** that learns from real hunt outcomes to provide hyper-local predictions.

**NOT building:**
- ❌ Custom LLM (waste of money, GPT-4 is better)
- ❌ Mass market product (yet)
- ❌ Complex scraping systems

**BUILDING:**
- ✅ Personal hunting AI for you + hunting buddies
- ✅ Outcome tracking system that learns from real hunts
- ✅ Local data moat that big players can't replicate quickly
- ✅ Rock-solid product before any public launch

---

## **STRATEGIC APPROACH**

### Phase 1: Friends-First (Current - 3 months)
- Build for 5-10 close hunting buddies
- Log every single hunt with detailed outcomes
- Prove predictive accuracy improves over time
- Perfect the UX for real field use

### Phase 2: Local Expansion (3-6 months)
- Open to local hunting community
- Build data advantage in specific regions
- Refine based on diverse user feedback

### Phase 3: Controlled Launch (6-12 months)
- Only after proven accuracy and solid data moat
- By then, have proprietary data big players can't match

**Key Insight:** GPT-4 reading YOUR proprietary hunt data = effectively a custom hunting LLM, but better and cheaper.

## **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### What Will Make This Work:
1. **Real Data Volume** - 50+ logged hunts minimum to prove accuracy
2. **Honest Feedback** - Your hunting buddies need to report failures too
3. **Consistent Use** - Has to be used every hunt, not occasionally
4. **Field-Tested UX** - Must work in real hunting conditions (cold, gloves, poor signal)
5. **Proven Accuracy** - Need measurable improvement in success rates

### What Will Kill This:
1. **Feature Creep** - Adding cool features before core works
2. **Poor Data Quality** - Incomplete or dishonest outcome logging
3. **Premature Launch** - Going public before proven with friends
4. **Ignored Mobile UX** - Desktop-first thinking
5. **Losing Focus** - Chasing custom LLM dreams instead of building what works

---

## **COMPETITIVE MOAT STRATEGY**

### Why Big Players Can't Copy You Quickly:
1. **Proprietary Data** - Your logged hunts are unique and valuable
2. **Local Knowledge** - Hyper-specific to regions you've tested
3. **Trust Network** - Hunter communities trust peer recommendations
4. **Speed** - You can move faster than corporate hunting apps

### How to Protect Your Advantage:
1. **Move Fast** - Build data moat before they notice
2. **Go Deep** - Own specific regions with tons of logged data
3. **Build Community** - Loyal users won't switch even if copied
4. **Stay Focused** - Don't announce publicly until defensible

## **DECISION LOG**

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **2025-10-03** - Cut all custom LLM infrastructure (waste of $200)
2. **2025-10-03** - Focus on GPT-4 + Supabase learning system instead
3. **2025-10-03** - Friends-first launch strategy (5-10 users)
4. **2025-10-03** - Delay public launch until proven accuracy
5. **2025-10-03** - Prioritize data moat over features

### Assumptions to Validate:
- [ ] Hunters will consistently log hunt outcomes
- [ ] 50+ logged hunts is enough for pattern recognition
- [ ] GPT-4 can effectively analyze hunt patterns from Supabase
- [ ] Friends will give honest feedback (including failures)
- [ ] Mobile-first design works in field conditions

## **NOTES FOR FUTURE CLAUDE/DEVELOPERS**

If you're reading this after chat was lost:

1. **The custom LLM stuff is DEAD** - Don't waste time on Python training scripts
2. **The core product WORKS** - Chat interface, weather, lunar data all functional
3. **Focus on OUTCOME TRACKING** - That's the missing piece for learning system
4. **Friends-first strategy** - Do NOT launch publicly yet
5. **Data is the moat** - Logged hunts with outcomes = competitive advantage

**Current blocker:** Need to wire up outcome tracking backend and verify Supabase schema.

**Next milestone:** Get 5 hunting buddies logging hunts consistently.

**Last updated by:** Claude (2025-10-03)
**Next review date:** After first 10 hunts logged
**Status:** 🚧 In active development - friends-first phase
