# ðŸŽ¯ HUNT WET AI - THE REAL ROADMAP

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-03 (Post-Alignment Session)

---

## **THE VISION: HYPER-LOCAL OUTDOOR INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM**

### **What We're Actually Building:**

**NOT:** Another hunting chatbot
**NOT:** AI that predicts the future
**NOT:** Generic hunting advice

**YES:** Google for hunters - hyper-local information aggregation
**YES:** One screen that replaces 20+ websites
**YES:** AI that reasons about YOUR data, not magic predictions

---

## **THE TWO-TIER STRATEGY**

### **FREE TIER = THE HOOK**
**"Complete Hunting Information Hub for ANY Location"**

**What it does:**
- User enters ZIP code or GPS location
- Gets EVERYTHING needed to hunt that specific area:
  - Current weather conditions (live)
  - Hunting seasons (state-specific, unit-specific)
  - Regulations & laws (bag limits, legal hours, orange requirements)
  - License/tag requirements (with direct buy links)
  - Public land access (BLM, USFS, state land maps)
  - Success rates (historical harvest data)
  - Local resources (processors, taxidermists, gear shops)
  - Road conditions, wildfires, trail reports
  - Limited AI chat (5 questions/day)

**The value proposition:**
- Replaces: CPW website + weather.com + OnX + forums + Google Maps + 15 other tabs
- Saves: Hours of research
- Provides: Everything in one organized screen, updated daily

**Why this is the hook:**
- Solves immediate pain: "I need to figure out how to hunt here"
- Works for ANY location (scout new areas, out-of-state hunts)
- No account required, no credit card, just useful
- SEO goldmine (rank for 10,000+ "hunting + location" searches)
- Massive traffic potential

**Monetization (even free tier):**
- Display ads (hunting gear CPM: $10-20)
- Affiliate links (license sales, gear, guides)
- Sponsor placements (local outfitters, processors)

---

### **PREMIUM TIER = THE MONEY MAKER**
**"Track YOUR Hunting Intelligence"**

**What it adds ($4.99/month or $49/year):**
- Unlimited AI questions (vs 5/day free)
- Hunt outcome logging (simple button taps):
  - "Did you hunt today?" [Yes] [No]
  - "How'd it go?" [Success] [Activity] [Quiet] [Nothing]
  - "Weather feeling?" [Perfect] [Good] [Meh] [Bad]
- Pattern recognition from YOUR logged data
- Success rate tracking (YOUR stats)
- 30-day hunting calendar
- Future hunt planning ("What if I hunt Nov 15?")
- Weather shift alerts
- Hunt journal & photos
- Crew comparison (optional social)
- Save unlimited locations (vs 3 free)

**The value proposition:**
- Free tier shows the AREA data
- Premium shows YOUR success patterns in that area
- AI reasoning: "Based on YOUR 47 logged hunts..."
- Correlations: "When YOU feel weather is 'perfect' + pressure rising = 83% success"
- Your gut instinct, quantified

**The upsell:**
- User already hooked on free information hub
- "Want to track YOUR patterns? $4.99/month"
- Low friction (price of coffee)
- High value (personal hunting intelligence)

---

## **THE DATA MOAT STRATEGY**

### **Why This Is Defensible:**

**Free tier data (not defensible):**
- Anyone can scrape state websites
- Anyone can aggregate public data
- Weather, seasons, regulations = publicly available
- **Competitors can copy this**

**Premium tier data (HIGHLY defensible):**
- User-logged hunt outcomes = proprietary
- "Weather feeling" correlations = unique dataset
- Pattern recognition = requires time + volume
- Network effects = more users = better predictions
- **Competitors CANNOT copy this without years of data collection**

### **The Flywheel:**

```
Free users use info hub
  â†“
Share with hunting buddies (viral growth)
  â†“
10% convert to premium ($50/year)
  â†“
Premium users log hunt outcomes (DATA)
  â†“
More logged hunts = better pattern recognition
  â†“
Better patterns = more accurate AI reasoning
  â†“
More users want premium (better product)
  â†“
More premium users = more data
  â†“
MOAT GETS STRONGER
```

**Timeline to defensibility:**
- Month 6: 1,000 logged hunts (early patterns)
- Month 12: 5,000 logged hunts (credible insights)
- Month 18: 20,000 logged hunts (strong moat)
- Month 24: 50,000+ logged hunts (nearly impossible to replicate)

**Big players (OnX, HuntStand) CAN copy the free tier in 6 months.**
**Big players CANNOT copy 50,000 logged hunts in 6 months.**

---

## **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**

### **Initial Market (Hunters):**
- 11.5M US hunters
- Target: 1% penetration = 115,000 users
- At 10% premium conversion = 11,500 paying users
- At $50/year = $575,000 annual revenue

### **Expansion Markets (Same Model):**
- Fishing: 50M+ anglers
- Camping/Hiking: 50M+ enthusiasts
- Birdwatching: 45M+ watchers
- Foraging: Growing community
- Off-roading: Huge market
- **Total: 150M+ outdoor enthusiasts**

**The wedge strategy:**
1. Nail hunting first (proof of concept)
2. Expand to fishing (same model, different data)
3. Expand to all outdoor activities
4. Become "the outdoor intelligence layer"

---

## **REVENUE MODEL**

### **Year 1 Projections (Conservative):**
```
Free users: 1,000
Premium users: 100 (10% conversion)
Premium revenue: $4,900/month = $58,800/year
Ad revenue: $500/month = $6,000/year
Affiliate revenue: $300/month = $3,600/year
Total Year 1: $68,400
```

Ad revenue: $3,000/month = $36,000/year
Affiliate revenue: $2,000/month = $24,000/year
Total Year 2: $648,000
```

### **Year 3 Projections (Scale):**
```
Free users: 100,000
Premium users: 10,000 (10% conversion)
Premium revenue: $490,000/month = $5,880,000/year
Ad revenue: $20,000/month = $240,000/year
Affiliate revenue: $10,000/month = $120,000/year
Total Year 3: $6,240,000

At this scale: Acquisition target ($10-50M range)
```

## **COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**

### **Existing Players (Why They Haven't Done This):**

**OnX Hunt:**
- Focus: Maps, land ownership
- Miss: Real-time conditions, AI reasoning
- Weakness: No pattern tracking, generic advice

**HuntStand:**
- Focus: Weather + basic planning
- Miss: Aggregated info hub, learning from outcomes
- Weakness: Not hyper-local enough

**State Agency Websites:**
- Focus: Regulations, seasons
- Miss: Everything else
- Weakness: Terrible UX, fragmented

**Weather Apps:**
- Focus: General weather
- Miss: Hunting-specific intel, regulations
- Weakness: Not outdoor-focused

**Forums/Reddit:**
- Focus: Community knowledge
- Miss: Organized, reliable data
- Weakness: Outdated, anecdotal

**Nobody has connected: Data + Tech + Hunting + AI into one platform.**

### **Why We Win:**

1. **First-mover advantage** (18-24 month head start)
2. **Data moat** (logged outcomes impossible to replicate quickly)
3. **Network effects** (more users = better product)
4. **Focus** (hunters-first, not corporate)
5. **Speed** (we move fast, they move slow)

---

## **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Core Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (serverless)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **APIs:**
  - Weather: OpenWeatherMap
  - Lunar: Custom calculations
  - Geocoding: OpenStreetMap Nominatim
  - State data: Web scraping + APIs
- **Hosting:** Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- **Auth:** Simple password (friends-first), upgrade to proper auth later

### **Data Model (Corrected):**

**Primary:** Lat/lon coordinates (not ZIP codes)
**Why:** More accurate, works internationally, better for APIs
**Display:** Show ZIP/city for user understanding, but store coordinates

**Location object:**
```javascript
{
  lat: 39.2904,
  lon: -76.6122,
  displayName: "Towson, MD",
  displayZip: "21286",
  county: "Baltimore County",
  state: "Maryland",
  wildlife_unit: "Region B",
  elevation: 456
}
```

**Hunt session object:**
```javascript
{
  user_id: "bob_smith",
  location: {lat: 39.29, lon: -76.61},
  date: "2025-10-15",

  // User-logged (the gold)
  hunted: true,
  outcome: "success" | "activity" | "quiet" | "nothing",
  weather_feeling: "perfect" | "good" | "meh" | "bad",

  // Auto-captured at time of hunt
  conditions: {
    temp: 42,
    pressure: 30.15,
    pressure_trend: "rising",
    wind_speed: 8,
    wind_direction: "NW",
    moon_phase: 0.73,
    moon_name: "waning_gibbous"
  },

  // Optional
  notes: "Saw 3 does at 7:15am",
  photos: ["url"],
  start_time: "06:15",
  end_time: "09:30"
}
```

---

## **RISK MITIGATION**

### **Risk 1: Competitors Copy Us**
**Mitigation:**
- Move FAST (MVP in 4 weeks, not 4 months)
- Build data moat (premium users logging outcomes)
- Focus on community/trust (not corporate feel)
- Timeline: 18-24 months before big players notice

### **Risk 2: Users Don't Log Outcomes**
**Mitigation:**
- Make logging DEAD SIMPLE (3-5 button taps)
- Show immediate value ("You just improved AI accuracy!")
- Gamification elements (streaks, milestones)
- Only premium users need to log (they're invested)

### **Risk 3: Data Scraping Fails**
**Mitigation:**
- Build scrapers with fallbacks
- Manual data entry for important locations
- Crowdsource updates (users report changes)
- Partner with state agencies (official data feeds)

### **Risk 4: Market Too Niche**
**Mitigation:**
- Hunting is wedge, not end market
- Expand to fishing, camping, etc. (proven model)
- 11.5M hunters is large enough for validation
- Focus on depth (hunters love data) over breadth initially

### **Risk 5: Can't Monetize**
**Mitigation:**
- Multiple revenue streams (premium, ads, affiliates)
- Test pricing early ($4.99/month validated)
- Free tier drives traffic (ads make money even without premium)
- Data itself is valuable (can license insights)

---

## **DECISION LOG**

### **Key Decisions Made:**

**2025-10-03:**
1. âœ… Killed custom LLM infrastructure (waste of $200, GPT-4 better)
2. âœ… Simplified to: Free info hub + Premium data logging
3. âœ… Lat/lon primary (not ZIP codes)
4. âœ… Friends-first launch (password protection)
5. âœ… Speed over perfection (4 weeks to MVP)
6. âœ… Focus on data moat (not feature complexity)
7. âœ… AI reasons about YOUR data (not predictions)

### **Key Assumptions to Validate:**

- [ ] Hunters will use free information hub (test with friends)
- [ ] 10% convert to premium (industry standard, need to validate)
- [ ] Premium users will log outcomes consistently (make it easy)
- [ ] Patterns emerge from 50+ logged hunts (test with own data)
- [ ] SEO traffic will come (build content, measure)
- [ ] Hunters will pay $50/year (test pricing)
