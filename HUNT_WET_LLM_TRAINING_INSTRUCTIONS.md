scp hunt_wet_final_training.json root@your-runpod-ip:/workspace/
scp hunt_wet_final_training.jsonl root@your-runpod-ip:/workspace/
```

## STEP 3: Upload Training Scripts
```bash
# Upload all training files
scp runpod_train.sh root@your-runpod-ip:/workspace/
scp process_hunt_wet_data.py root@your-runpod-ip:/workspace/
scp train_hunt_wet_llm.py root@your-runpod-ip:/workspace/
scp deploy_hunt_wet.py root@your-runpod-ip:/workspace/
scp requirements.txt root@your-runpod-ip:/workspace/
```

## STEP 4: Start Training (ON RUNPOD)
```bash
# SSH into RunPod instance
ssh root@your-runpod-ip

# Make script executable and run
chmod +x runpod_train.sh
./runpod_train.sh
