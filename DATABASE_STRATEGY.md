# HUNT WET AI - DATABASE & DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY

## **CORE PRINCIPLE: DATA IS THE PRODUCT**

Hunt Wet AI is fundamentally a **data collection engine** disguised as a hunting intelligence platform.

Every interaction, every search, every outcome = data = competitive advantage.

---

## **THE DATA MOAT**

### **Why Data Matters:**
- Free tier (info hub) can be copied by big players
- Premium tier (outcome logging) **CANNOT** be copied quickly
- User-logged hunt outcomes = proprietary data = defensible moat
- Timeline: 18-24 months to build significant advantage before OnX/HuntStand notice

### **What Makes It Defensible:**
1. **User-Generated Data**: Hunt outcomes logged by thousands of users
2. **Network Effects**: More users → more data → better patterns → more users
3. **Location Specificity**: Hyper-local patterns tied to exact coordinates
4. **Time to Replicate**: Would take competitors 18-24 months to collect similar data

---

## **DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Free Tier (Months 1-3)**
**Goal:** Capture search patterns, popular locations, user behavior

**What We Log:**
- Every location search (ZIP entered, GPS used)
- Every question asked (hunting intent, game type)
- Every weather condition fetched
- Every regulation viewed
- Time of day, day of week, seasonality

**Value:**
- Identify popular hunting areas
- Understand user questions/needs
- Build SEO content (location pages)
- Traffic = ad revenue potential

**Tables:**
- `locations` - Every unique location searched
- `hunting_sessions` - Every chat interaction
- `location_weather_history` - Weather snapshots

---

### **Phase 2: Premium Launch (Months 4-6)**
**Goal:** Start logging hunt outcomes (THE GOLD)

**What We Log:**
- Did you hunt? (yes/no/planned)
- Did you see game? (count)
- Did you harvest? (yes/no)
- Weather conditions during hunt
- Moon phase during hunt
- Time of day hunted
- Location (lat/lon)

**Value:**
- Success rate by location
- Success rate by weather condition
- Success rate by moon phase
- Pattern recognition: "83% of successful hunts in this area happened when..."

**Tables:**
- `hunt_outcomes` - Every logged hunt result
- `success_patterns` - Computed aggregations

---

### **Phase 3: Pattern Recognition (Months 7-12)**
**Goal:** Enough data to show real patterns

**What We Compute:**
- "In your area, hunters have 78% success rate when..."
- "Cold fronts in ZIP 21286 produce 2.3x more deer movement"
- "Dawn hunts in October in Maryland = 64% success rate"

**Value:**
- AI can reference real patterns
- Premium users see value: "Based on YOUR 47 logged hunts..."
- Conversion funnel: Free users see aggregate patterns, want personalized

**Analysis:**
- Aggregate by location (10-mile radius)
- Aggregate by weather patterns
- Aggregate by moon phase
- Aggregate by time of day/season

---

### **Phase 4: Moat Built (Months 13-18)**
**Goal:** Data becomes defensible competitive advantage

**What We Have:**
- 10,000+ logged hunt outcomes
- Patterns for 500+ locations
- Success rates by condition type
- Proprietary algorithm: "When to hunt"

**Value:**
- OnX/HuntStand can't replicate without 18 months of data collection
- Premium conversion increases (better patterns = more value)
- Acquisition potential (buy for the data)

---

## **DATABASE SCHEMA OVERVIEW**

### **Data Collection Tables**

#### **`locations`** - Track Popular Hunting Areas
```sql
- latitude, longitude (primary keys)
- display_name, display_zip
- search_count (DATA: How many times searched)
- last_searched_at (DATA: When last searched)
- unique_users (DATA: How many different users)
```
**Use Case:** Identify hotspots, build SEO pages, target ads

---

#### **`hunting_sessions`** - Every Chat Interaction
```sql
- user_id, session_fingerprint
- latitude, longitude, zip_code
- game_type, hunt_date
- user_message, ai_response
- weather_data, moon_phase_data (FULL SNAPSHOT)
- barometric_pressure, temperature_f, wind_speed_mph
- hunt_outcome (free = null, premium = logged)
```
**Use Case:** Train AI, understand questions, improve responses

---

#### **`hunt_outcomes`** - THE GOLD (Premium Tier Only)
```sql
- user_id (required - premium only)

```
**Use Case:** AI references: "Based on 83 hunts in your area..."

---

#### **`location_weather_history`** - Historical Weather Data
```sql

- recorded_at (timestamp)
```
**Use Case:** "Last 5 cold fronts in this area produced..."

---

#### **`hunting_regulations`** - Aggregated State Data
```sql
- state_code, county, zone
- game_type, species
- season_start, season_end
- bag_limit, legal_weapons
- source_url, last_verified_at
```
**Use Case:** Free tier hook (replaces 20+ websites)

---

#### **`user_profiles`** - Premium Tier Tracking
```sql
- user_id, email
- subscription_tier ('free', 'premium')
- subscription_start, subscription_end
- primary_game_types
- saved_locations (array)
- total_searches, total_hunts_logged
```
**Use Case:** Revenue tracking, retention, personalization

## **DATA COLLECTION IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Every Location Search:**
```typescript
// page.tsx - handleLocationSubmission()
await trackLocationSearch({
  latitude: location.lat,
  longitude: location.lon,
  display_name: location.displayName,
  display_zip: location.displayZip
})
```
**Result:** `locations` table tracks search frequency

---

### **Every Chat Interaction:**
```typescript
// openai.ts - getHuntingAdvice()
await createHuntingSession({
  latitude: context.latitude,
  longitude: context.longitude,
  zip_code: zipCode,
  user_message: context.userMessage,
  ai_response: response,
  weather_data: weatherData,
  barometric_pressure: weatherData.current.barometricPressure,
  temperature_f: weatherData.current.temperature,
  wind_speed_mph: weatherData.current.windSpeed
})
```
**Result:** Full interaction logged with weather snapshot

---

### **Every Weather Fetch:**
```typescript
// weather.ts - getWeatherForHunting()
await storeWeatherSnapshot({
  latitude: lat,
  longitude: lon,
  temperature_f: data.main.temp,
  barometric_pressure: data.main.pressure,
  wind_speed_mph: data.wind.speed,
  conditions: data.weather[0].main,
  cold_front: detectColdFront(data)  // Algorithm
})
```
**Result:** Historical weather database for pattern analysis

## **REVENUE FROM DATA**

### **Direct Revenue (Premium Tier):**
- $4.99/month or $49/year
- 1,000 premium users = $60K/year
- 10,000 premium users = $600K/year

- API access (sell aggregated data)

### **Acquisition Value:**
- OnX valued at $150M+ with 1M+ users
- Hunt Wet AI with 10K premium + 100K free + proprietary outcome data = $5-10M acquisition target

---

## **DATA PRIVACY & ETHICS**

### **User Data:**
- Location tracking: Explicit (user enters ZIP or grants GPS)
- Outcome logging: Opt-in (premium tier only)
- No personal info required (email optional)
- Anonymous user IDs (no real names)

### **Data Usage:**
- Aggregate patterns: Yes (anonymized)
- Individual hunts: Private (only user sees their own)
- Sell personal data: NEVER
- Sell aggregated patterns: Maybe (anonymized, no individual data)

### **Transparency:**
- Users know data is collected (ToS)
- Users see value (better patterns = better predictions)
- Users control data (can delete account)

---

## **COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS**

### **OnX Hunt:**
- Strength: Land ownership maps, offline maps
- Weakness: No outcome tracking, no pattern recognition
- Data moat: Property data (public records)
- Time to copy us: 18-24 months

### **HuntStand:**
- Strength: Weather integration, social features
- Weakness: No AI, no pattern recognition
- Data moat: None (features can be copied)
- Time to copy us: 18-24 months

### **Hunt Wet AI Advantage:**
- Proprietary hunt outcome data
- User-logged results = network effects
- AI-driven pattern recognition
- First-mover advantage in outcome tracking

---

## **NEXT STEPS**

1. ✅ **Schema created** (`supabase-schema.sql`)
2. ✅ **Data collection functions** (`supabase-setup.ts`)
3. ✅ **Location tracking integrated** (`page.tsx`)
4. ✅ **Session logging updated** (`openai.ts`)
5. ⏳ **Deploy schema to Supabase**
6. ⏳ **Build info hub with data collection**
7. ⏳ **Build premium tier outcome logging**

---

## **THE BOTTOM LINE**

**Hunt Wet AI is not a hunting app.**

**Hunt Wet AI is a data collection engine that gives hunters value in exchange for data.**

- Free tier = Traffic + search patterns + questions
- Premium tier = Hunt outcomes + success patterns + THE MOAT
- 18-24 months = Defensible competitive advantage
- 2-3 years = Acquisition target

**Every line of code should ask: "What data does this capture?"**
